# Dice-Game

Dice-Game is a simple web-based game where the website rolls the dice for two players on refreshing, and the player with the higher number wins. If both players roll the same number, the game is a draw. This project leverages HTML5 and CSS3 for structuring and styling the web page, while JavaScript is used to implement the game logic through DOM manipulation.

## Project Overview
The Dice-Game project demonstrates a simple game logic where two players compete by rolling dice. The player with the higher number wins, and if both players roll the same number, the game results in a draw. This project helped me gain a better understanding of JavaScript and how to manipulate the DOM.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content on the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and DOM manipulation.

## Features
- **Simple Game Logic**: Generates a random number for each player and determines the winner based on these numbers.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Uses JavaScript to update the web page content dynamically based on game outcomes.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the game looks good on various devices and screen sizes.
